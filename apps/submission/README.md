# Pan Canadian Genome Library Data Submission Service

<img src="../../docs/img/pcgl-logo.png" height="90" align="right" />

> The Pan-Canadian Genome Library (PCGL) is a large collaborative effort to unify Canada's genome sequencing efforts. The PCGL is an open-source and open-science initiative, building upon Canadian-made foundational components and datasets, and utilizing international standards such as GA4GH to unify Canadaâ€™s human genome sequencing efforts.

This application is a wrapper around the [@overture-stack/lyric](https://github.com/overture-stack/lyric) package, enabling efficient handling and management of data submissions. It adapts Lyric's functionality to meet PCGL requirements, ensuring reliable data submission and data management.

## Getting started

### Development tools

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) Dependency manager
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) Runtime environment (v20 or higher)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) As recommended code editor. Plugins recommended: ESLint, Prettier - Code formatter, Mocha Test Explorer

### System Dependencies

- [Postgres Database](https://www.postgresql.org/) for data storage
- [Dictionary Manager](https://github.com/Pan-Canadian-Genome-Library/dictionary-manager) PCGL Dictionary Management and validation

> For development purpose, a `docker-compose.yml` is provided to spin up required services.

### Quickstart Development

1. Install Dependencies:

   ```
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Build the Workspace:

   ```
   pnpm build:all
   ```

3. Set Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.schema`. See Environment Variables section below.

4. Start the Server in Development Mode:

   ```
   pnpm start:dev
   ```

   Server runs on port `3030` by default.

5. Interact with API Endpoints:
   Access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:3030/api-docs/`
